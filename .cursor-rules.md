# Cursor Project Rules (Private)

ðŸ§  These are internal rules for the Cursor AI assistant when working on this project.

## Git Commit Rules

- After every meaningful file change or task completion, create a Git commit with a descriptive message.
- Commit messages must summarize the action performed (e.g. "created Angular app structure").
- If several small changes are logically related, group them into a single commit.

## Development Rules

- The Angular app should live inside the `frontend/` folder.
- The app will eventually connect to a backend REST API.
- Use Angular version 17 or 18.
- All AI interaction and code generation should happen in English.
