# Cursor Project Rules (Private)

ðŸ§  These are internal rules for the Cursor AI assistant when working on this project.

## Git Commit Rules

- After every meaningful file change or task completion, create a Git commit with a descriptive message.
- Commit messages must summarize the action performed (e.g. "created Angular app structure").
- For each new feature or step, create a separate Git branch (named descriptively).
- After completing the work in the branch, merge it back into the `main` branch.
- Every action that modifies the project in any way must first create a new Git branch and commit the change immediately, even if the modification is minimal.

## Development Rules

- The Angular app should live inside the `frontend/` folder.
- The app will eventually connect to a backend REST API.
- Use Angular version 18.
- Use Bootstrap (standard CSS version) as the UI framework.
- All AI interaction and code generation should happen in English.

## Language Rules

- All AI responses should be given in English, regardless of the interface language.

## Automation Mode
- Run all non-destructive actions automatically without preview.
